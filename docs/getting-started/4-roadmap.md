`initium` Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. The documentation is at [initium.nearform.com](https://initium.nearform.com), while guides are being migrated over to the new documentation page. A major refactor of `initium` is on the way, you can [follow this PR](https://github.com/nearform/initium/pull/7443) for updates.

### Help needed

In case you are a maintainer of a package that uses Initium, feel free to [reach out to Luca Lanziani](https://twitter.com/lucalanziani), if you want to collaborate on making it an official package, maintained in our repository. If you are interested in bringing it support to your favorite runtime application, we would love to hear from you!

#### Community Packages

While we are migrating the documentation and working on stabilizing the core package, the community has been working on some packages that are already available. With collaboration, we hope to make these packages official in the future.
